## Project Overview
This project presents an AI-powered Emergency Department (ED) triage system designed to improve patient prioritisation and reduce overcrowding in Malaysian hospitals. The system allows patients to input their personal details and symptoms through a user-friendly web interface, after which the Gemini API is used to analyse the input and classify cases into **Critical, Urgent, or Non-Urgent categories**.

By leveraging the **Gemini** large language model, the system generates structured clinical insights, including urgency level, possible conditions, red flags, and recommended next steps in a consistent JSON format. This enables fast and reliable triage support for both patients and healthcare staff. This system demonstrates how AI-assisted triage can enhance decision-making, optimise patient flow, and reduce the burden on emergency department staff, contributing to more efficient and responsive healthcare services.

## Problem Statement
Emergency Departments (EDs) in Malaysia are increasingly overwhelmed due to rising patient demand and limited healthcare resources. A significant proportion of ED visits consist of non-urgent cases, which contributes to congestion, long waiting times, and delays in treating critically ill patients.

Current triage processes in many hospitals are still manual and dependent on healthcare staff, leading to variability in assessment, increased workload for nurses, and potential delays during peak hours. These challenges are further compounded by staffing shortages, bed limitations, and inefficient patient flow within hospitals.

As a result, ED overcrowding can lead to:

- Delayed medical attention for critical patients
- Increased risk of clinical errors
- Reduced quality of patient care
- Higher stress and burnout among healthcare workers

This project addresses these challenges by introducing an AI-assisted triage system that enables early patient screening, improves prioritisation, and supports more efficient emergency care delivery.

## Solution
A self-service AI triage kiosk at the ED entrance:
 
1. Patient walks in and fills in personal info + symptoms
2. Selects symptoms from checklist + rates pain level (0–10)
3. **Gemini AI** analyses using structured clinical reasoning
4. Patient receives instant colour-coded result:
   - 🔴 **CRITICAL** — Seek help immediately
   - 🟡 **URGENT** — Seen within 30 minutes
   - 🟢 **NON-URGENT** — General queue
> **Scope:** Walk-in patients only. Accident and trauma cases go directly to medical staff as per standard hospital protocol.

## Google AI Ecosystem — Build With AI Requirement
 
### Google AI Studio 
- Designed and tested our structured clinical triage prompt
- Validated Gemini responses across all urgency scenarios
- Published and deployed application directly to Google Cloud Run
- Monitored API usage and response quality
  
### Gemini API — gemini-3-flash (Intelligence)
Core AI reasoning engine. Receives structured patient data and returns:
 
```json
{
  "urgency": "CRITICAL | URGENT | NON-URGENT",
  "urgency_reason": "One sentence clinical reasoning",
  "possible_conditions": ["condition1", "condition2", "condition3"],
  "red_flags": ["flag1", "flag2"],
  "next_step": "One clear instruction for the patient"
}
```
 
### Google Cloud Run (Deployment)
- Serverless deployment — publicly accessible URL
- Auto-scales with demand
- Zero cost when idle
- Deployed via Google AI Studio publish feature
